New Weapons:

The new weapons, and a copy of the old ones, are in the prefabs/weapons folder.
Drag them in the WeaponContainer bone in the soldier bone hierarchy for propper placement in right hand.

The base models keep their original weapon attached, as removing it may cause updating problems in projects 
made with previous versions

Shotguns use all the assault animation set, except for the shoot animations.

Handgun and knife set should use the assault death animations


New Textures:
Yellow, Grey and Black Soldier materials added.



The next update will probably be the last one, it will include a rocket launcher and some other animations.
